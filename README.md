Hello my name is Jessica Fenn. I am a student from Michigan. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future.

## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview -This week, I spent time editing the README file and practicing version control, while also learning what the terminal is and getting more comfortable with GitHub.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I'm having trouble navigating the terminal and git hub, I think it will take time to get used to, but right now it's intimidating.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I broke my work into smaller pieces this week, and spreading the different tasks out over multiple days really helped me.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I plan to focus on setting clearer priorities between work, school, and family life, making sure to tackle the most important tasks first. I’ll also stick to a bite sized routine so I can spread things out and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

### Week 1

This week, I dove headfirst into getting familiar with the terminal and GitHub, and started building a workflow around project management. I downloaded GitHub to my desktop, set up my work environment, and began learning basic terminal commands and GitHub shortcuts.
