## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of core JavaScript concepts by implementing four custom functions and testing them with Jest. Each function includes basic error handling and validation to make sure they behave correctly under different input conditions.

## Functions Implemented

1. **sumOfArray(arr)**  
   Returns the sum of all numbers in an array. Non-number elements are ignored.

2. **reverseString(str)**  
   Reverses the characters in a string. Converts non-string input to a string before reversing.

3. **isPalindrome(str)**  
   Checks whether the provided string reads the same forward and backward. Ignores punctuation and capitalization.

4. **purgeDuplicates(arr)**  
   Removes duplicate values from an array and returns a new array of unique values.

## Functional Testing

All tests were written using Jest.
